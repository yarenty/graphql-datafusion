## 🔧 GraphQL Schema

The API provides these main query types:

### Core Queries
- `tables`: List available tables
- `table_count(tableName)`: Get row count for a table
- `customers(limit, offset)`: Query customer data
- `orders(limit, offset)`: Query order data

### Analytics Queries
- `salesAnalytics`: Comprehensive sales analysis
- `naturalLanguageQuery(input)`: AI-powered query translation
- `insights(input)`: AI-generated business insights
- `agentStatus`: Check AI agent status

### Example Queries

**Basic Customer Query:**
```graphql
query {
  customers(limit: 5) {
    c_custkey
    c_name
    c_acctbal
    c_mktsegment
  }
}
```

**Sales Analytics:**
```graphql
query {
  salesAnalytics {
    totalSales
    totalOrders
    avgOrderValue
    topCustomers {
      customer {

        c_mktsegment
      }
      totalSpent
    }
  }
}
